  "param1" : "Alessio Romagnoli is working hard to recover from the calf injury he sustained back in July. Previous reports suggested that he would be back toward the end of this month and this has materialised. The 25-year-old trained on the Milanello pitch earlier today, following a personalised program. He has started to train with the ball again and on Instagram, the captain confirmed that he’s on his way back.",
  "param2" : "For Milan, it will be very important to get Romagnoli back in action, especially considering the current defensive crisis. Above all, though, he’s one of the best defenders in the squad."
