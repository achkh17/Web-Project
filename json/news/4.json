  "param1" : "An extraordinary day. Gigio Donnarumma was, as usual, the Rossoneri's bulwark between the sticks, denying the hosts at every turn. It was a very Gigio performance, the likes of which we're well accustomed to by now. He is the MVP of Benevento v AC Milan, edging out Kjer and Leao.",
  "param2" : "In a difficult game, our number 99 shone, making five saves, two of which - against Letizia in the first half and Lapadula on the verge of full time - were incredibly decisive. Caprari did do him a slight favour though, missing from the spot and allowing him to keep his fifth clean sheet of the season in the league, after those against Bologna, Crotone, Spezia and Fiorentina. Keep it up, Gigio!"
