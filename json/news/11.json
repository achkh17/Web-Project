  "param1" : "After struggling to make an impact upon his arrival from Villarreal, the winger feels ready to make his mark at the Giuseppe Meazza. Samu Castillejo thinks he has finally found his feet at Milan and hopes to stay at the club for a long time.",
  "param2" : "Milan signed Castillejo in August 2018 in a deal worth a reported €18 million (£16m/$20m) but he struggled to establish himself initially, starting just eight Serie A games in his first season at San Siro. The 25-year-old was linked with a move away in the previous transfer window, with Atletico Madrid and Espanyol said to have been interested."
