  "param1" : "After seeing red after just 17 minutes against Juventus in the Coppa Italia in our first game back, question marks were raised over Ante Rebic’s ability to lead the line for Milan. It isn’t the first time that the 26-year-old Croatian international has faced adversity since moving to Italy, as his time in Serie A began with a goal and assist drought which stretched eight games, while he spent a further eight games on the bench.",
  "param2" : "It’s fair to say by mid-January there were serious doubts over his future at San Siro, and then things finally clicked into place against Udinese on January 19 and Rebic hasn’t looked back since.He now has seven goals in 16 Serie A appearances this season along with a goal and assist in the Coppa Italia, and while the majority of that influence came while playing out wide on the left, he showed against Lecce on Monday night that he can also deliver as the lone frontman in Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s absence."
