  "param1" : "After a lot of great performances in a very steady season, Davide Calabria has now scored his first goal of the campaign. His equaliser to make it 1-1 was powerful, long-range effort. A peach of a finish, together with a display replete with grit and sustainance, which convinced our fans to choose him as their MVP from Genoa 2-2 AC Milan, with over 55% of the votes; ahead of Kalulu, Donnarumma and Çalhanoğlu.",
  "param2" : "Calabria played all 90 minutes of the game at Marassi, in which he completed 49 passes, recovered the ball 11 times, completed three long balls and three crosses, as well as winning two duels. After the game, he said that it Milan TV, I'm happy to have scored, we're scoring a lot of goals as a team, which is important. We always want to win. We're a bit disappointed but we did well to not give up, right to the very end. Wise words from one of the in-form players in this side. Keep it up, Davide"
