   "param1" : "For the second game running - and the third in four matches after Parma and Sassuolo - Theo Hernández is the Rossoneri's MVP. As usual, the flying French full-back made the difference. He stepped up to the plate when we needed him most, as the game was drawing to a close, first sending in a wonderful ball to Rebić before, more importantly, heading the Diavolo to victory. As the team began to tire and as the clock wound down, the Rossoneri's number 19 displayed boundless power and energy to drive home the goal to make it 3-2. A goal that sent us all wild, which would have made San Siro erupt; our fans, however, did make their voices heard, voting him as their MVP for AC Milan v Lazio with almost 80% of the votes, ahead of Çalhanoğlu and Rebić.",
  
  "param2" : "At this point of the season, after 20 appearances in Serie A and the Europa League, Hernández has already scored four goals and provided five assists. These are incredible numbers of a truly elite player. In the 90 minutes yesterday evening, beyond the goal scored, he completed 33 passes, made six recoveries, completed four dribbles and created two chances. He's a player blessed with both power and beauty - a true force of nature - and adds immeasurable worth to the side. The superlatives are almost done, now we can but sit back and admire each time, and we'll never tire of watching him perform to this level. Outstanding, Theo! "
