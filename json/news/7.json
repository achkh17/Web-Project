  "param1" : "It was a complete performance from Alexis Saelemaekers on Sunday, whose involvement was previously in doubt after a knock sustained against Napoli. After overcoming this niggle, he has since been voted MPV from AC Milan v Fiorentina. His progression from February to now is clear to see, as has been his ability in both attack and defence. He was decisive in securing the Rossoneri’s first penalty against the Viola, but his contribution spanned way beyond just that. ",
  "param2" : "Saelemaekers enjoyed 92 minutes of action before being replaced by Dalot at San Siro, completing 56 passes and winning possession back on five separate occasions. His activity levels remained constant throughout the match, while his quality never dropped. His performance was enhanced by his solid link-up play with Calabria down the right. Well done, Alexis, you are the Rossoneri’s MVP from AC Milan v Fiorentina!"
