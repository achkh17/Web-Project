  "param1" : "With concise roles handed by Pioli, Kessie is the muscle of the team. This is not to undermine Bennacer’s physicality, but Kessie is asked to assert his physicality over the opposition’s midfield and keep a tight rein on their creative players.",
  "param2" : "In Milan these roles are fulfilled by Bennacer and Kessie. While Kessie is the box-to-box man, Bennacer takes on the role of playing as a quasi-regista. Speaking the common language of French, Bennacer and Kessie’s good chemistry has been very pivotal in Milan’s press as well as counter-press."
