  "param1" : "On 200 games in Red and Black: ”200 matches mean many things, I see them as a starting point and not as a point of arrival. I hope to play 200 more games, if not more. I’m always proud to be the Milan captain and I’ll always give my best in every match.”",
  "param2" : "On the arrival at Milan: ”I said yes at the first moment, a call from the coach was enough. All the rest was done by Galliani and by my former agent. Milan means Champions, trophies, and victories, I have always felt part of a family. I arrived very young and I’ve been here for six years and I can’t ask for anything better, it was love at first sight.”"
