  "param1" : "He is the captain of the team, an example for his teammates to follow and one of the leading voices on the pitch. Today, 12 January, Alessio Romagnoli turns 26. A little more than a month ago, he made his 200th appearance for the Club and has played 17 times this season, scoring once (against Fiorentina at San Siro) and providing one assist (against Genoa): good personal stats in an overwhelmingly positive season for the whole team. Romagnoli is not lacking for aims: keeping up the good work for AC Milan, furthering his level of performances, both in Italy and Europe - especially with the Euros with Italy on the horizon. He's strong, tenacious and, from today, one year older: Happy Birthday, Alessio!",
  "param2" : "He spoke to Rai Sport’s microphones after the game to reflect on the win, with his words transcribed by MilanNews and translated below. It’s the best way to celebrate my birthday. Tough game, Toro played well. We had several scoring chances and in the end we are managed to win,- he said. We do not give up anything. The championship is long, we think game after game. Now Cagliari, then Atalanta: we try to do our best, as always."
