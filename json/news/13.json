  "param1" : "Training resumed this afternoon at Milanello, albeit in reduced numbers due to numerous National team players having been called up to represent their countries. The team got back together after three days of rest granted by Coach Pioli.",
  "param2" : "The Rossoneri began in the gym at 15:30 CET to carry out their warm-up, before taking the field. At the beginning of their training they undertook a series of exercises that focused on speed with the help of low obstacles and shapes. The group was subsequently split into two parts that alternated between three different stations to perform technical exercises and fitness work. To conclude, a small game was played on a reduced portion of the pitch."
