  "param1" : "He compared himself to Benjamin Button, a man born old but who gets younger as the years progress. And in reality, it really does seem that way if you watch him on the pitch. His life seems like it's straight out of a film, his career is that of a champion. Today, 3 October, Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ is 39 years old.",
  "param2" : "It's an occasion that comes in the midst of very uncertain times, especially given he tested postitive for COVID-19. He was forced to self-isolate at home, but the Swede will no doubt find the strength to celebrate, just as he found the strength to take this news in his stride. The team and fans are eagerly awaiting his return. After eleven goals in the second half of last season, after three goals in two games to start this campaign, the best is surely yet to come. On behalf of the entire Rossoneri family"
