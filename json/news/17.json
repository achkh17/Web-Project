  "param1" : "In both the Europa League preliminary stages and the Eliteserien, the Norwegian top flight, Hauge has demonstrated all his qualities this season. In 20 matches in the league, he’s managed to find the net 14 times (double the amount he’s scored in any other season in the Eliteserien) and provide ten assists in 20 matches. In Europe, meanwhile, he’s registered three goals and two assists. He’s always been a precocious talent: on his first-team debut for Bodø/Glimt on 13 April 2016, he scored a 14-minute hat-trick against Fløya in Norway’s national cup competition at the age of 16. On 8 July 2016, he became the youngest player in Bodø’s history to score in the Eliteserien when he converted a penalty against Ik Start. Starting from his debut in Norway’s top division (in 2016) and taking account all those born from 1996 onwards, Jens Petter Hauge (1999) is the only player to have scored at least 20 goals (22 for him).",
  "param2" : "Jens Petter Hauge started out at U15 level, going on to work his way up through the Norwegian youth ranks. Now, the senior side has come calling: he was recently named in Lars Lagerbäck's squad for Norway’s Nations League matches against Serbia, Romania and Northern Ireland. AC Milan’s new signing was involved in Norway’s remarkable 12-0 win against Honduras at the U20 World Cup in 2019. Erling Håland, a close friend of his, scored nine goals that match, with Hauge providing four assists and also getting on the scoresheet himself."
