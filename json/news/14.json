  "param1" : "Important and decisive goal for Alessio Romagnoli in AC Milanâ€™s today 2-0 victory against Fiorentina. The Captain gave the Rossoneri the lead and his goal also served to respond in the perfect way to recent criticism.A sort of revenge for Romagnoli who celebrated the goal in a passionate way and caused controversy. Immediately after the ball hit the net Alessio was headed towards the camera making gestures with his hand. The Italian centre back looked like he was saying shut up to his critics.",
  "param2" : "A move that according to DAZN, was not received well even by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swedish center forward, out due to injury but present at the stadium, has rebuked Romagnoli for his gesture. The Rossoneri captain had received negative comments after causing two penalties in recent games. A sort of rebound for him not only for the goal scored but also for the solid performances in defence alongside Kjaer. Nevertheless, the controversy continued even after the match. The 25-year-old defender posted a photo on Instagram with the following message: Less words and more deeds. Sempre Forza Milan"
